## Roasted Cabbage with Capers and Garlic

* ½ cup extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for drizzling 
* ¼ cup capers, finely chopped 
* 3 garlic cloves, finely chopped
* Zest of 1 lemon 
* ¼ cup lemon juice (from 1 to 2 lemons), or more as needed
* Salt and pepper 
* 1 medium green cabbage (2½ to 3 pounds)
* Handful of chopped parsley or torn basil leaves

1. Heat the oven to 450 degrees.
2. Place the olive oil, capers, garlic, lemon zest and lemon juice into a small bowl and stir to combine. Season generously with salt and black pepper. Taste to make sure the oil is both very lemony and salty, adjusting seasonings as needed.
3. Prepare the cabbage: Remove any wilted outer leaves, then halve the cabbage through its core. Place both halves flat side down on a cutting board and slice through the core into 1½-inch-thick wedges.
4. Drizzle a rimmed sheet pan with olive oil and gently transfer the cabbage, keeping each wedge intact and placing them flat-side down in a single layer. Spoon about half of the garlicky caper oil evenly over the cabbage and, using your hands, gently massage it in, pressing the garlic and capers over and between the leaves. Season lightly with salt and pepper.
5. Roast the cabbage until tender, golden at the edges and caramelized, 25 to 30 minutes.
6. Transfer the cabbage to serving plates. Drizzle the remaining garlicky caper oil over each wedge, scatter with parsley or basil, and serve.
