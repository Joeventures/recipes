# Instructions

1. Flatten and paper towel dry the chicken.
2. Prepare two large bowls:
	* One bowl for the egg, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and Italian seasoning. Whisk together.
	* Another bowl for the Flour, Bread Crumbs, and Cheese. Mix together.
3. Double dredge each chicken breast:
	* Dredge each chicken breast piece in the egg mixture.
	* After that, place in dry ingredient mixture and press. Turn to coat the other side and press again.
	* Repeat to add a second coat of each.
4. Melt the butter to start and add olive oil to start in a skillet.
5. Place coated chicken in skillet and cook for 3-4 minutes on one side. Do not move chicken, or else the cheese will slide off the surface before it adheres.
6. Turn with tongs and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Sprinkle parsley flakes on top of the just-cooked side.
7. Add lemon juice to the pan while chicken is cooking.
8. Turn again, sprinkle parsley flakes.
9. If all the butter/olive oil mix reduces away, add more of each. Flip one more time to set the parsley flakes in the coating.
