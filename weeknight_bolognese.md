# Weeknight Bolognese

## Ingredients
* 1 lb ground beef
* 1 medium onion, diced or sliced
* 1 carrot, diced
* 1 celery stalk, diced
* 2 white mushrooms, sliced
* 3-4 cloves, minced garlic
* 1 24 oz jar, Rao's marinara
* 1 can diced tomatoes
* 2 tbsp tomato paste
* Olive oil
* Salt & Pepper
* 1.5 tsp Italian seasoning
* 1/2 tsp dried basil
* 1/2 tsp dried oregano
* 1/2 cup milk, half-and-half, or heavy cream
* 3/4 cup dry red wine
* 3/4 cup beef broth

## Directions
1. **Prep Aromatics:** Heat 2 tbsp olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add onion, carrot, and celery. Cook 6-8 minutes until softened and starting to lightly brown.
2. Add garlic, cook 1 minute more.
3. Add Italian seasoning and stir 30-60 seconds.
4. **Brown the Beef:** Add ground beef, breaking it up with a spoon. Season with salt and pepper. Cook until most liquid evaporates and beef is no longer pink (about 8-10 minutes).
5. **Add Tomato Elements:** Stir in tomato paste and diced tomatoes. Cook 2-3 minutes (this caramelizes the tomato paste for deeper flavor).
6. **Deglaze and Simmer:** Add red wine and broth, dried basil, and oregano. Let it bubble and reduce by about half.
7. Add entire jar of marinara and bring to a gentle simmer.
8. **Add Dairy, the classic bolognese secret:** Stir in milk. This softens the acidity and makes everything velvety.
9. **Slow Simmer:** Simmer uncovered at low heat for a minimum of 30-45 min. Ideally 60-90 min, stirring occasionally.
10. Taste, adjust salt and pepper.
11. Add 2-3 tbsp chopped fresh basil at the end, if desired.
