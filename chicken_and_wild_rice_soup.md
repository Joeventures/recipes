* 6 cups chicken broth
* 2 chicken breast halves (cooked, boneless and cubed)
* 1 6-ounce package long grain and wild rice blend, quick cooking (You will use the seasoning packet. The author of this recipe used Uncle Bens roasted chicken flavor)
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 3/4 cup butter (12 tbsp, or a stick and a half)
* 1 cup carrot, diced
* 1 cup celery, diced
* 1 cup onion, diced
3 cups light cream (can lighten by substituting part or all of the cream with fat-free evaporated milk, or half-and-half)

1. Open rice, pull out seasoning packet. Set aside.
2. In a small bowl, combine pepper and flour. Set aside.
3. In a large pot over medium heat, combine broth and chicken. Bring to a boil, then stir in rice. Cover and remove from heat.
4. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, melt butter. Add carrots, celery, and onion. Saute for 5 minutes.
5. Stir in contents of seasoning packet. Continue cooking vegetables until softened, about 5 minutes more.
6. Add seasoned flour gradually while constantly stirring, to form a roux. Saute roux for 3-4 minutes to cook out raw flour taste.
7. Whisk in cream, a little at a time, until fully incorporated and smooth. Cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.
8. Stir cream mixture into broth and rice. Cook over medium heat until heated through and rice is done, about 15-20 minutes.
