# Chili (November 2024 Attempt)

## Ingredients

* 1/2 lb red kidney beans
* 1/2 lb pinto beans
* 2 green jalapenos
* 2 red chile peppers
* 1 tbsp olive oil
* 1 lb 90%+ lean ground beef
* 1 large onion, diced
* 3 cloves garlic or 2 tbsp minced garlic
* 2 cans diced fire roasted tomatoes
* 1 can tomato paste
* 2 tbsp chili powder (this was too much ðŸ”¥)
* 2 1/2 tsp cumin
* 2 tsp paprika
* 2.5 tbsp better than bouillon beef soup base mixed with 1 cup hot water

## What I did

1. Sort and overnight soak beans.
2. Roast the peppers, peel skins, remove seeds, and chop.
3. Saute onion for at least 3 minutes, then add garlic and saute for another 30 seconds. Pour into slow cooker.
4. Brown beef. Keep the fat.
6. Put all ingredients in the slow cooker and stir just enough to combine.
7. Cook in slow cooker 5 hours (high to start, then low for final hour).
