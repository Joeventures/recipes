# Baked Honey Garlic Chicken Thighs

- [ ] 2 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs *If using skin-on or bone-in, see notes.
- [ ] 1/2 cup honey
- [ ] 2 TBSP water
- [ ] 6 garlic cloves, grated to a paste or minced
- [ ] 2 TBSP apple cider vinegar
- [ ] 2 tsp Worcestershire sauce
- [ ] 1 tsp liquid smoke
- [ ] 1 tsp extra virgin olive oil
- [ ] 2 TBSP Montreal Steak Spice
- [ ] 1 TBSP Corn starch
- [ ] 2 TBSP cold water

1. Preheat oven to 400ยบ F.
2. Place the chicken thighs onto a paper towel covered surface, like a plate or cutting board, and blot them dry with more paper towels to remove excess moisture; set aside.
3. In a mixing bowl, whisk together the honey, some water, garlic, apple cider vinegar, Worcestershire, liquid smoke, olive oil, and Montreal Steak Spice until well blended.
4. Transfer the chicken thighs to the mixing bowl and toss them to evenly coat them. (If you're making this in advance, you can do this earlier, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and set in the fridge.)
5. With tongs, transfer the chicken thighs to a braiser and pour the rest of the sauce over the thighs.
6. Place the thighs in the oven and bake for about 25 minutes.
7. Whisk some cornstarch and water together in a small bowl, and once the thighs have cooked for 25 minutes, pour the cornstarch mixture over chicken. Using tongs, flip the chicken around and mix the cornstarch into the sauce.
8. Bake for another 5-7 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened, is lightly bubbling, and the chicken has reached an internal temperature of 165ยบ F.
9. Remove the chicken from the oven. Garnish with fresh parsley (optional), and serve.

If you're using skin-on chicken thighs, I'd suggest giving them a quick sear, skin-side down, on a hot pan before placing them in the oven to bake. That way you end up with a nice crisp on your skin rather than being left with a slimy skin. It might even be worth giving the thighs a short trip under the broiler before serving. Use your best judgement.

If you're using bone-in chicken thighs, cooking time may vary.
