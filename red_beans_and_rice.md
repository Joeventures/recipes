Day 1:

Add enough water to the red beans to cover them by 1 to 4 inches and soak overnight in the refrigerator. As the beans soak up the water they will more than double in volume.

Day 2:
1. Combine the seasoning mix ingredients in a small bowl.
2. Drain the beans and set them aside.
3. Preheat a heavy 5 qt pot, preferably non-stick, over high heat to 350 degrees, about 4 minutes.
4. Add 2 cups of the onions, the bell peppers, and the celery, and 1 tablespoon of the seasoning mix.
5. Stir and cook until the vegetables start to turn brown, about 5 minutes.
6. Add 1/2 cup of the stock, scrape the bottom of the pot to clear all the browned bits, and cook 3 minutes.
7. Add the remaining 1 cup of onions, stir, and cook 5 minutes.
8. Add the drained beans, 5 cups of the stock, and the remaining seasoning mix. Stir and cook for 45 minutes, scraping the bottom of the pot occasionally to check for sticking. Add 1 cup grape juice and continue to cook for 25 minutes.
CAUTION: At this point, the starches in the beans start to break down and sticking will occur more often. It is therefore important to check and clear the bottom of the pan frequently.
9. Add the remaining stock and grape juice, turn the heat to medium, and cook until the beans are tender, and the liquid is thick and begins to look creamy, about 30-35 minutes. Serve over the rice.
