* 1 cup Fine bulgur wheat
* 1/2 diced green bell pepper
* 1 diced medium-large onion
* Red pepper flakes
* Pine nuts
* 1 1/2 teaspoons cumin
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/2 cup ketchup
* 1/2 cup apple butter
* 1/2 cup olive or vegetable oil
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* chopped parsley

Be careful of the bulgur wheat you choose. Make sure it is fine, not coarse. Generally, you won't be able to find this kind of bulgur wheat at any large grocery chain.

Soak and drain bulgur wheat three times, then set it aside.

Dice the onion and pepper, then combine with bulgur wheat. Combine all other ingredients.
